# Prophusion demo project
Use this repository as-is to try out a Prophusion+PHPUnit project, 
or use it as a template to incorporate Prophusion testing into your own project.
 
 
* Try it: as shown in this [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/oF_tr2QIGRU).  
  Requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
  and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Be sure to run `composer install`
  after cloning!
* Incorporate it in  your own project: Grab `docker-compose.yml` and `run-tests.sh`.
